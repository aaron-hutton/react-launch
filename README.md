# React Launch Component

Launch dialogs or notifications in your react app from anywhere.

# Quick Features

- No need to clutter components with `isOpen` state for dialogs
- Group all of your apps dialogs in one place
- Pass arguments to your dialogs or notifications with full type-safety
- Launch your components from anywhere

# Motivation

Sometimes it's useful to be able to launch a dialog or notification as a function call, such as on a button click or after a server call. This library a type-safe way to do that without cluttering your component.

Simply pass a list of the dialogs or notifications into the provider, call the hook in your component and you can launch your dialogs without any extra state. You can even pass type-safe arguments directly into your dialogs.
